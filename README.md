The employees of the BPES Company are worked on day time (8.00 am to 5.00 pm duty) under the labor rule policy and their attendance are taken from the fingerprint machine. The process of BPES is as follows;
  1. The supervisor of this company receive the fingerprint details of excel sheet from the HR Manager of the ZPMC Company and he send this excel sheet to the relevant   team engineer to approve his employee’s attendance.
  2. The relevant engineer of the team daily note down each employee’s attendance and each employee submit OT sheet document to engineer when they work over time.
  3. After the engineer receives the fingerprint sheet, he compares the given sheet and his journal and correcting the sheet if there any mistake in it and then mails to the supervisor after approving it.
  4. Then the supervisor collects fifteen days attendance details like above mentioned way and mailed to the HR manager once in fifteen days.
  5. The HR manager has excel sheet and he has to copy and paste the all check-in and check-out time of each employee to his excel sheet manually.
